//1. What is a Starter?
// A starter in Spring Boot is a pre-package set of dependencies that
// you can add to your project to enable a specific feature without manually
// searching for and configuring each library yourself.

// Think of it as a combo meal:
// - Instead of ordering bread, meat, cheese, and sauce separately, you just 
//   order a "Burger Meal" and it comes with everything in the right quantity.
// - In coding terms: Instead of adding Tomcat, Jackson, and Spring MVC one-by-one,
//   you just add spring-boot-starter-web.


//2. Why Starters Exist
// Before starters:
// - You had to find compatible versions of libraries.
// - If one library version didnâ€™t work with another, you were in dependency hell.
// - You needed to write a lot of boilerplate configuration.

// After starters:
// - You just add one dependency.
// - Spring Boot pulls in all required libraries and versions that work well together.
// - Auto-configuration kicks in to set everything up.
