//1. Java Verson
// - Spring Boot runs on Java, so you must have a supported Java version installed.
// - Spring Boot always supports the latest Java LTS (Long-Term Support) version and
// - sometimes the most recent non-LTS.
// - Check your Java version using `java -version`


//2. Build Tools
// You can build Spring Boot apps using:
// - Maven (default choice in most tutorials)
// - Gradle (faster builds, more modern syntax)

//  Recommendation for beginners: Start with Maven because:
// - Most Spring Boot docs & examples use Maven.
// - Easier to read XML-based pom.xml files when starting out.
// Check you Maven version using `mvn -v`
// if you don't have it, download it at  https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

//3. IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
// You can use any Java IDE, but:
// - IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition is free) → Best Spring Boot integration.
// - Eclipse → Also good with Spring Tools.
// - VS Code with Java extensions → Lightweight alternative.

//4. Common Mistakes to Avoid
// - Using Java 8 or 11 for the latest Spring Boot — some features won’t work.
// - Forgetting to set JAVA_HOME environment variable.
// - Mixing Maven & Gradle in the same project (pick one).
